#Meeting Summary AlphaCandy 2022-09-08

#####Meeting between Leon (lecturer) and project team members Tim & Robin (Marc couldn't make it)

##Project scope

Due to time issues the project team decided to lower the project scope.
The new approach is to run a DDQN and a PPO on the environment, vary the field size and the number of candies and 
compare the results. 

Leon says that this would be fine, but the evaluation of the project would benefit from something that is clearly above 
the homework requirements.

The suggestion is to add and train a predefined decision transformer from the tfm.nlp framework.
Tim wants to have a look at it and probably orient it on BERT or build it himself.
Concerning using a sequence length of 10, Leon says that he maybe would have aimed at 20 or 50, but 10 should be fine.

The team will arrange another meeting if further questions emerge.
